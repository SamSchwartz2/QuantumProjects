This is a loose collection of some more quantum physics-focused notebooks I've worked on (mostly in QuTip) with descriptions below:

aho_jch.ipynb: Anharmonic Oscillator and James Cummings Hamiltonian evolutions

b92.ipynb: B92 QKD scheme both with and wihtout Eve's intercepting presence

decoherence.ipynb: Qubit decoherence from excited to ground state

disp_ramset.ipynb: Displacement operator phase space diagrams and Ramsey spectroscopy analysis of a quantum harmonic oscillator

more_decoherence.ipynb: You guessed it!

rwa_timeev.ipynb: Rotating wave approximation time evolution and other quantum state time evolutions

split_dsp: spiritual continuation of b92 - this notebook shows the power of photon splitting attacks and the decoy state protocl as an effective defense mechanism against such attacks

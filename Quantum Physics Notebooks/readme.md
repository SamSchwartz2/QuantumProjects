This is a loose collection of some more quantum physics-focused notebooks I've worked on (mostly in QuTip) with descriptions below:

aho_jch.ipynb: Anharmonic Oscillator and James Cummings Hamiltonian evolutions

decoherence.ipynb: Qubit decoherence from excited to ground state

disp_ramset.ipynb: Displacement operator phase space diagrams and Ramsey spectroscopy analysis of a quantum harmonic oscillator

rwa_timeev.ipynb: Rotating wave approximation time evolution and other quantum state time evolutions

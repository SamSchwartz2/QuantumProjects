This is a loose collection of some more quantum physics-focused notebooks I've worked on (mostly in QuTip) with descriptions below:

aho_jch.ipynb: Anharmonic Oscillator and James Cummings Hamiltonian evolutions
rwa_timeev.ipynb: Rotating wave approximation time evolution and other quantum state time evolutions
